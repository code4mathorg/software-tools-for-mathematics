# Software Tools for Mathematics

The workshop is composed of two parts. The first two days are dedicated to a [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/about/) workshop and to more general computer tools. The rest of the week (three days) are dedicated to more mathematical topics.

It makes sense to also make it a [Sage Days](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops) event.

**Past workshops:**

* [Morelia](http://www.matmor.unam.mx/software-tools-math/), Mexico, January 2018
* [Koper](http://stm.famnit.upr.si), Slovenia, September 2018

## The format

### Software Carpentry

The Software Carpentry workshops in Morelia and Koper covered
* the basics of the [Unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/),
* [version control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and
* [programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)

Ideally, Software Carpentry provides qualified instructors to teach these topics.

### Tools for mathematics

The second half of the workshop is dedicated to minicourses (for commonly used tools), contributed talks and a problem session.

So far, we had the following minicourses:
* GAP (Morelia, Koper),
* LaTeX: BibTeX and TikZ (Koper),
* Pari/GP (Morelia)
* SageMath with CoCalc and Jupyter (Morelia, Koper).

## Financial matters

A non-zero registration fee is recommended.

### Expenses

Software Carpentry normally charges a [fee](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/), which they are sometimes willing to waive.  The hosts are expected to cover the travel expenses and accommodation for the Software Carpentry instructors.

So far we have been able to do the same for the minicourse instructors, too.

## Technical issues

The participants are expected to bring their own laptop for two reasons. First, the organizers do not have to produce 30-40 machines. Second, more importantly, it is usually the case with computer workshops that skills learned on a different machine tend not to get used as much after the workshop. While participants using their own laptops requires a greater effort on the organizersâ€™ side (installation and setting up), it is effort the participants do not have to invest in using the tools on their computers. In the past workshops, we dedicated time to help participants set their laptops up for the workshop and it paid off.

A well set up lecture room makes a big difference. A local mirror for software installers can decrease the internet load. Even so, everybody uses internet fairly heavily (especially those who use CoCalc in the cloud), making a good connection (wifi and/or ethernet) vital to the smooth running of the workshop. There should also be nearly one electricity outlet per participant.
